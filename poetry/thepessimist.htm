<h2 align="center">The Pessimist</h2>
<p align="center">
by P.G. Wodehouse<br>
<br>
THEY tell me that the weather's fair,<br>
The day serene and balmy;<br>
No more for rain need I prepare --<br>
No chilly blast shall harm me.<br>
They prate of 'warmth', of 'gentle glows',<br>
They rave of how sublime it is;<br>
I shake my head, as one who knows<br>
Just what the British climate is.<br>
<br>
They say the trees are growing green,<br>
That flowers are in bloom,<br>
That bees and butterflies are seen;<br>
They bid me quit my room.<br>
My hat and boots to me they bear.<br>
They tell me what crime it is<br>
To stay indoors; but I'm aware<br>
Just what the British climate is.<br>
<br>
The tale they tell is just the same<br>
They told in days of yore.<br>
I know the weather's deadly game --<br>
I've seen it played before.<br>
I call it deadly: well, to those<br>
By nature such as I'm, it is.<br>
One suffers much before one knows<br>
Just what the British climate is.<br>
<br>
This is my fixed resolve -- to keep<br>
Thick clothing always handy,<br>
Add extra blankets when I sleep,<br>
And not run short of brandy.<br>
I wager we'll be having snow<br>
Before midsummer-time it is.<br>
I'll take no risks. I chance to know<br>
Just what the British climate is.<br>
