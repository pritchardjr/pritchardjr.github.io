<h2 align="center">When I Heard the Learn'd Astronomer </h2>
<p align="center">
by Walt Whitman<br>
<br>
When I heard the learn'd astronomer,<br>
When the proofs, the figures, were ranged in columns before me,<br>
When I was shown the charts and diagrams, to add, divide, and measure them,<br>
When I sitting heard the astronomer where he lectured with much applause in the lecture-room,<br>
How soon unaccountable I became tired and sick,<br>
'Till rising and gliding out I wander'd off by myself,<br>
In the mystical moist night-air, and from time to time,<br>
Look'd up in perfect silence at the stars.<br>
