<h2 align="center">The Rolling English Road</h2>
<p align="center">
by G K Chesterton <br>
<br>
 Before the Roman came to Rye or out to Severn strode,<br>
 The rolling English drunkard made the rolling English road.<br>
 A reeling road, a rolling road, that rambles round the shire,<br>
 And after him the parson ran, the sexton and the squire;<br>
 A merry road, a mazy road, and such as we did tread<br>
 The night we went to Birmingham by way of Beachy Head.<br>
<br>
 I knew no harm of Bonaparte and plenty of the Squire,<br>
 And for to fight the Frenchman I did not much desire;<br>
 But I did bash their baggonets because they came arrayed<br>
 To straighten out the crooked road an English drunkard made,<br>
 Where you and I went down the lane with ale-mugs in our hands,<br>
 The night we went to Glastonbury by way of Goodwin Sands.<br>
<br>
 His sins they were forgiven him; or why do flowers run<br>
 Behind him; and the hedges all strengthening in the sun?<br>
 The wild thing went from left to right and knew not which was which,<br>
 But the wild rose was above him when they found him in the ditch.<br>
 God pardon us, nor harden us; we did not see so clear<br>
 The night we went to Bannockburn by way of Brighton Pier.<br>
<br>
 My friends, we will not go again or ape an ancient rage,<br>
 Or stretch the folly of our youth to be the shame of age,<br>
 But walk with clearer eyes and ears this path that wandereth,<br>
 And see undrugged in evening light the decent inn of death;<br>
 For there is good news yet to hear and fine things to be seen,<br>
 Before we go to Paradise by way of Kensal Green.<br>
