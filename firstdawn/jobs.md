### Postdoctoral researcher in 21cm cosmology and Epoch of Reionization

[Job advertisement and electronic application](https://www4.ad.ic.ac.uk/OA_HTML/OA.jsp?page=/oracle/apps/irc/candidateSelfService/webui/VisVacDispPG&akRegionApplicationId=821&transactionid=901212982&retainAM=Y&addBreadCrumb=S&p_svid=45307&p_spid=1707176&oapc=7&oas=_93cndhu4DZWhvQArxnYEw)

We are seeking a highly motivated researcher for a three-year position available from April 2015. This position will be based within the Imperial College Astrophysics Group to work with Jonathan Pritchard as part of a dedicated group studying 21cm mapping of the Epoch of Reionization supported by ERC Starting Grant Award “FirstDawn”.

The aim of the project is to better understand the intensity fluctuations in the 21cm and other atomic and molecular lines from the Epoch of Reionization and Cosmic Dawn. This will involve refining theoretical predictions for the 21cm signal and developing statistical techniques to extract properties of the first galaxies from upcoming observations with upcoming radio interferometers such as HERA and the Square Kilometre Array. Areas of particular interest are more accurate inclusion of radiative backgrounds and non-linear growth into semi-numerical simulations, statistical analysis of the 21 cm signal, better understanding of limitations imposed by instrumental effects and foreground removal, and the interplay between 21cm observations, line intensity mapping, and other probes of reionization.  Depending upon the interests of the successful candidate there will be opportunities to work on one or more of these interlocking areas. The post holder will be expected to contribute to the Department’s teaching activities up to approximately half a day per week during the academic year, as appropriate. The position comes with funds for travel and computers. The successful candidate must have a Ph.D. by the anticipated start date.

Please submit applications electronically via the advertisement on the Imperial College Webpage
You will be asked to fill out a web form and to upload a CV, list of publications, statement of research interests, and the names of three referees. Review of applications will begin on 2 March, 2015.
