### PhDs

I\'ll actively be looking for a PhD student to work on 21cm/reionization/SKA topics this year. The application deadline for STFC funded places is in mid-February 2016. Please get in touch if you\'re interested in applying for one of these or for an Imperial College Scholarship.

Information on the astrophysics group\'s PhD application proceedure is <a href="http://astro.ic.ac.uk/postgrad">here</a>.

### Fellowships

There are a number of UK prize fellowships that might be of interest - STFC Rutherford, Royal Society URF, Marie-Curie IOF, and RAS fellowship. I\'m happy to discuss supporting prospective candidates.

Information on Imperial\'s processes for supporting fellowship applications is <a href="http://astro.ic.ac.uk/content/job-opportunities">here</a>.

### Postdocs

I\'ll likely be advertising an ERC funded postdoctoral research position in October 2015. Watch this space or get in touch if you\'re interested.
