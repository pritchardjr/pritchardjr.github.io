<h2 align="center">Sea-Fever</h2>
<p align="center">
by John Masefield<br>
<br>
I must go down to the seas again, to the lonely sea and the sky,<br>
 And all I ask is a tall ship and a star to steer her by;<br>
 And the wheel's kick and the wind's song and the white sail's shaking,<br>
 And a gray mist on the sea's face, and a gray dawn breaking.<br>
<br>
 I must go down to the seas again, for the call of the running tide<br>
 Is a wild call and a clear call that may not be denied;<br>
 And all I ask is a windy day with the white clouds flying,<br>
 And the flung spray and the blown spume, and the sea-gulls crying.<br>
<br>
I must go down to the seas again, to the vagrant gypsy life,<br>
 To the gull's way and the whale's way, where the wind's like
 a whetted knife;<br>
 And all I ask is a merry yarn from a laughing fellow-rover,<br>
 And quiet sleep and a sweet dream when the long trick's over.<br>
<br>
