<h2 align="center">Cosmic Gall</h2>
<p align="center">
by John Updike <br>
<br>
Neutrinos, they are very small. <br>
They have no charge and have no mass <br>
And do not interact at all. <br>
The earth is just a silly ball <br>
To them, through which they simply pass, <br>
Like dustmaids down a drafty hall <br>
Or photons through a sheet of glass. <br>
They snub the most exquisite gas, <br>
Ignore the most substantial wall, <br>
Cold-shoulder steel and sounding brass, <br>
Insult the stallion in his stall, <br>
And, scorning barriers of class, <br>
Infiltrate you and me! Like tall <br>
And painless guillotines, they fall <br>
Down through our heads into the grass.<br> 
At night, they enter at Nepal <br>
And pierce the lover and his lass <br>
From underneath the bed - you call <br>
It wonderful; I call it crass. <br>
