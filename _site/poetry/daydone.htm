<h2 align="center">The Day is Done</h2>
<p align="center">
by Henry Longfellow<br>
<br>
The day is done, and the darkness<br>
   Falls from the wings of Night,<br>
As a feather is wafted downward<br>
   From an eagle in his flight.<br>
<br>
I see the lights of the village<br>
   Gleam through the rain and the mist,<br>
And a feeling of sadness comes o'er me,<br>
   That my soul cannot resist:<br>
   <br>
A feeling of sadness and longing,<br>
   That is not akin to pain,<br>
And resembles sorrow only<br>
   As the mist resembles the rain.<br>
   <br>
Come, read to me some poem,<br>
   Some simple and heartfelt lay,<br>
That shall soothe this restless feeling,<br>
   And banish the thoughts of day.<br>
<br>
Not from the grand old masters,<br>
   Not from the bards sublime,<br>
Whose distant footsteps echo<br>
   Through the corridors of Time. <br>
<br>
For, like strains of martial music,<br>
   Their mighty thoughts suggest<br>
Life's endless toil and endeavor;<br>
   And to-night I long for rest.<br>
   <br>
Read from some humbler poet,<br>
   Whose songs gushed from his heart,<br>
As showers from the clouds of summer,<br>
   Or tears from the eyelids start;<br>
<br>
Who, through long days of labor,<br>
   And nights devoid of ease,<br>
Still heard in his soul the music<br>
   Of wonderful melodies.<br>
<br>
Such songs have power to quiet<br>
   The restless pulse of care,<br>
And come like the benediction<br>
   That follows after prayer.<br>
<br>
Then read from the treasured volume<br>
   The poem of thy choice,<br>
And lend to the rhyme of the poet<br>
   The beauty of thy voice.<br>
<br>
And the night shall be filled with music<br>
   And the cares that infest the day,<br>
Shall fold their tents, like the Arabs,<br>
   And as silently steal away.<br>
