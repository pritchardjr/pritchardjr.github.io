<h3>Research</h3>
<hr></hr>
My first work was on the effect gravitational waves have on the CMB.  
At present I'm interested in the period of reionisation and the growth of structure.  
This period marks the transition between linear and non-linear physics being 
important and has a lot to tell us about the physics underlying both regimes.  
My current focus is the prospect of using the 21cm line to probe the physics of the epoch of reionization (EoR).  This field is still fairly speculative, but the potential gains in our understanding make it very exciting.
